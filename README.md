🧪 VirtuLab Africa

VirtuLab Africa is a virtual science learning platform that helps students learn science using interactive simulations and summarized curriculum notes.

It allows learners to:

Read clear science notes

Practice virtual experiments

Learn how to use laboratory apparatus

Understand safety rules and measurements

The app works on mobile, tablet, and desktop and is designed to support schools with limited laboratory resources.

This project is currently in MVP stage.
